# 5004
Code for my PHM5004 project.
Even though the code is in jupyter notebook, the code is in bash and is meant to be executed on HPC environment.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate the increase in computation speed and scalability of parallelisation and nextflow for RNAseq file processing.
